# Layla-PDFLib
An easy to use Java PDF rendering library
# Why another PDF library
Because PDF is everywhere, and we often need to show PDF files (or parts of) in our programs. Whether you are writing a Java program for the desktop, Android, or any other platform, you will reach the point where you will sometimes need to show PDF for some reason (e.g. help manual). A lot of Java PDF libraries are available out there, but all of them are difficult to use, and need a lot of time and brain power to understand and use. This library promises to be ridiculously easy to use. A few lines of code and you get a PDF page, ready to show on your program.
